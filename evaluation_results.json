      "question": "How does machine learning work?",
      "answer": "To answer the question of how machine learning works, we need to delve into its fundamental components and processes. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.\n\n1. **Data Collection**: The first step in machine learning is collecting data relevant to the task you want the machine to learn. This data is used to train the machine learning model.\n\n2. **Data Preprocessing**: After collecting the data, it needs to be preprocessed to ensure it's in a format that the machine learning algorithm can understand. This step can include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into appropriate formats.\n\n3. **Model Selection**: Next, a suitable machine learning algorithm (or model) is selected based on the nature of the task. Common types of machine learning tasks include classification, regression, clustering, and neural networks.\n\n4. **Training the Model**: The preprocessed data is then used to train the selected model. During training, the model learns patterns and relationships within the data by adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes.\n\n5. **Model Evaluation**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using a separate set of data (test data) that was not used during training. This step helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n\n6. **Deployment**: Once the model is deemed satisfactory, it can be deployed in real-world applications. The model can then make predictions or take actions based on new, unseen data.\n\n7. **Continuous Learning**: Many machine learning models can continue to learn from new data, allowing them to adapt and improve over time.\n\nIn the context of the provided documents, [1] mentions the use of natural language processing and knowledge representation, which are crucial in certain types of machine learning tasks, especially those involving text data. Vector Embedding, as mentioned in [2], is a technique used to represent words or documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space, which can be fed into machine learning models for tasks like text classification or clustering. Lastly, frameworks like Langchain, mentioned in [3], provide tools and structures for building and deploying AI applications, including those that use machine learning.\n\nTherefore, machine learning works by leveraging data, algorithms, and computational power to enable machines to learn from experience and improve their performance on specific tasks over time.",

      "question": "What are the applications of AI?",
      "answer": "The applications of AI can be diverse and widespread. According to the information provided in the global context, specifically in the document \"Dé cương đồ án Vũ Hoàng Hiệp.docx\" [1], LangChain is mentioned as a framework for building AI applications. This suggests that AI has applications in areas such as system development and technology application, which are related to LangChain as noted in the local context [1]. \n\nFurthermore, exploring the relationships of LangChain in the knowledge graph, we find connections to \"Hệ Thống Quản Lý Và Truy Vấn Tri Thức\" (system development, technology application) and \"Knowledge Graph\" (data querying, tool). This implies that AI applications can extend into managing and querying knowledge systems, contributing to the development of intelligent systems, and potentially enhancing data analysis and decision-making processes.\n\nWhile the provided context does not exhaustively list all applications of AI, it highlights the role of AI in technology and system development, as well as in managing and querying knowledge. Therefore, the applications of AI include, but are not limited to, system development, technology application, knowledge management, and data querying, leveraging tools like LangChain for building and implementing AI solutions.",
